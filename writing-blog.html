            <p>Being a child, I was never into reading all that much. It was only in highschool where I found myself picking up popular Young Adult novels. Boy, were they a blessing. It was sort of like having a portable ipad that had your favourite movie on it, but you could read it in class and nobody else would hear.</p>

        <article class="blogpage-article">
            <p>Throughout high school I made a few *cringey* attempts at writing. It’s okay though, because if you’ve ever gotten into creative writing, you know that the first X amount of attempts will be <b>[REDACTED]</b>. Huge pieces of <b>[REDACTED]</b> that you wouldn't dare show to your nearest relative.</p>

        <article class="blogpage-article">
            <p>Years later I decided I would write a book called <i>The Book Of Death</i>. The book follows three characters, each of which you know will die at the end of the book. Really cool idea, but my execution wasn’t quite there yet. Close, but no cigar.</p>

        <article class="blogpage-article">
            <p>I then went on to write a book called <i>Gifted</i>, which was also garbage. But I pulled my big-boy pants up and ended up re-writing it into my first decent book. Would you look at that, miracles do happen!</p>
        </article>

        <article class="blogpage-article">
            <p>About a year after that (my writing habits really are yearly, haha), I wrote two books in a series called the <i>House Of The Bat</i>. These books were decent enough to publish, and so publish I did. On Amazon. Where 3000 books are self published every day.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="blogpage-article">
            <p>Who knows–maybe one day I’ll go back and write the third and fourth books in the series! If you're keen to give them a read,<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/140761158-house-of-the-bat" target="_blank">here</a> is the link. Happy travels.</p>
