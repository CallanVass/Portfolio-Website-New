        <article class="blogpage-article">
            <p>When I was thirteen I sat down to watch a documentary on my crumby, barely-alive laptop that hummed like a jet engine the moment the temperature rose even slightly. The documentary was called Earthlings, and it detailed the standard practices throughout the animal agriculture industry. In retrospect I don’t quite know why I watched it. I suppose the reason boils down to this: I always want to know the truth, no matter what. For me, there is no comfort in living in ignorance: an onus that would grow with me into adulthood. </p>

        <article class="blogpage-article">
            <p>What I saw was disgusting. Animals treated like mere commodities, condemned to horrific atrocities for no other reason than tradition or culture. How could anyone treat these creatures like products when they’d come into the world with such an innocent curiosity? And how come nobody had told me about this yet?</p>
        </article>

        <article class="blogpage-article">
            <p>From that moment I vowed to go vegetarian. This worked for four years until I discovered a new ignorance I’d been living in: the dairy industry is the meat industry, and all dairy cows go on to become meat products. From that moment on I went vegan, and I’ve never looked back since.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="blogpage-article">
            <p>Here's the kicker–I don’t even like animals that much. Sure, I admire them, but that’s about where it stops. This would lead me to another truth I could apply to every animal and human being in my life: you don’t have to specifically like someone to not want to see them condemned to a horrible fate. Everyone deserves a chance to feel safe, to have their emotional, physical, and intellectual needs met.</p>

        <article class="blogpage-article">
            <p>Now I’m a member of the Animal Justice Party, and regularly attend events for animal rights. Why? Because if it were me in that cage, I’d want someone to give me a voice.</p>
